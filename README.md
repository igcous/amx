### Concept

A job board mobile app â€” to publish, search, and apply for jobs.  
Some users (**Recruiters**) can make posts, other users (**Job Searchers**) can like them, and then they match.  
The main goal is to make the process of applying for a job as **easy** and **fast** as possible.  
The app is focused on jobs in the **software industry**.

### Usage Flow

1. Users can create accounts with different roles (either a **Recruiter** or a **Job Searcher**).
2. Recruiters can create **Job Posts**.
3. Job Searchers can upload their **CVs**, review, and like Job Posts.
4. Recruiters can review and **accept** Job Searchers who previously liked their Job Posts.
5. If there's a match, Job Searchers and Recruiters can **message each other** through a chat.
